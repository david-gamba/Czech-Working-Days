[datetime.date(2023, 5, 1), datetime.date(2023, 4, 7), datetime.date(2023, 10, 28), datetime.date(2023, 12, 25), datetime.date(2023, 12, 26), datetime.date(2023, 4, 10), datetime.date(2023, 7, 5), datetime.date(2023, 11, 17), datetime.date(2023, 12, 24), datetime.date(2023, 5, 8), datetime.date(2023, 7, 6), datetime.date(2023, 9, 28), datetime.date(2023, 1, 1)]
